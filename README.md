# Learn Python 3 The Hard Way
The project is created for learning Python 3 based on `Learn Python The Hard Way` by Zed A. Shaw.

## Why I create this project?
Mainly for learning purpose. I will also write note for every exercise (if it is needed) in this README.


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
You need to have
1. [`Python3`](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Code editor like: [Atom](https://atom.io/)

### Installation
1. Clone this project (Using `git`command: `git clone https://github.com/vietdang7/LPTHW.git` or through your GitDesktop application)
2. Install Python 3
3. Install Atom

## Testing
In your terminal:
1. Move or `cd` to `LPTHW` (where you've just cloned the project)
2. Move or `cd` to the exercise folder that you wanted
3. Run `python3 file_name.py`. For example: `python3 ex1.py`
Please note: all exercise files are in "Exercises" folder.

## Exercise notes:
1. Exercise 1:
   - To print new line, we can use `print("\n")`
   - In Python3, `print` is now a function
2. Exercise 2:
   - Use # for commenting in Python
   - Read code backward to check errors manually
3. Exercise 3:
   - Use math symbols and print in the same line with a string (seperate by a ",")
   - "%" is a modulus
4. Exercise 4:
   - There will be space between string and variable when use print().
   For example: `print("There are",cars,"cars available.")` -> There are 100 cars available.
   To avoid space, we can use concatenation `+` or `print 'Value is "%d"' % value`
5. Exercise 5:
   - To format string and add variables inside, we will need to user `print(f"string {variableName}")`
